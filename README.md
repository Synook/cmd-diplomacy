# Command-line Diplomacy

This is an implementation of a Diplomacy game with command-line driven
interaction.

## TODO

- Web API
- Client (Python command-line tool)
- Visualisation (/map endpoint)
- Turn logic (hardest)
  - The 10 billion (not really) special cases
- Logging, so people know what's going on
